# Brute Force - Lock Overhaul SKSE

Only run logic if player is cause of action
Only run logic if target has a lock

When hitting a lock with a weapon following should be taken into consideration:
- Skill in weapon/armor type (two handed or one handed / heavy armor or light armor)
- Weapon type (blunt or sharp)
- Weapon dmg
- Skill requirement (novice, apprentice, adept, expert, master)

Use base damage of weapon to calculate damage to lock

When hitting a lock with a spell following should be taken into consideration:
- Skill in destruction
- Spell level (novice, apprentice, adept, expert, master)
- Skill requirement (novice, apprentice, adept, expert, master)


This is my first SKSE plugin. Other mods exists like this, but couldn't find one that did it in an SKSE plugin, so used it as a learning experience. Will probably work on this more to polish it in the future.

**What does it do different?**

I love playing as dumb barbarians that wouldn't care about lockpicking, but I also don't like restraining myself to a set level cap in order to access loot. Mostly because Skyrim, obviously, wasn't built that way. So instead of setting a minimum skill level in order to break open locks, I set a requirement for equipment instead.

The idea being that locks of a harder degree would be more sturdy and harder to break open. So while any weapon can bash open a novice lock, you'd need a steel weapon or better to break open an apprentice lock, and so on, until you need your daedric or dragonbone to access the master locks. While this could feel like a hindrance, I think it's a nice way to balance it, since you could rely on crafting, looting or just having luck finding a good weapon to break open locks. And you can still of course just lockpick it.

There are other modpacks that add unlock spells, so I left those out of this one. I might add them in the future, but for now I'm happy with this.

**Features:**

- Break locks using brute force:
	- Novice locks: Steel, Silver
	- Apprentice locks: Dwarven, Elven
	- Adept locks: Orcish, Nordic
	- Expert locks: Glass, Ebony, Stalhrim
	- Master locks: Daedric, Dragonbone

**Optional Features:**

There is a BruteForce.ini file that you can configure to adjust the gamplay experience, such as:

- Only allow blunt weapons to open locks
- Only allow two handed weapons to open locks
- Only allow warhammers to open locks
- Enable/disable skill requirement
- Configure skill increase
- Configure required skill to bash open locks
- Enabled/disable the mod.

**Roadmap**

**Version 2.0:**
- MCM config (with help of MCM helper)
- Better detection event
- More immersive calculation of lock bash to not always guarantee success
- "Simple" lock bash by using Activate event instead of Hit.
- Option to disable lockpicking if skill doesn't meet requirement

**Version 3.0**
- Use alchemy to melt locks
- Use shouts to break open locks.
- Destruction magic can unlock chests.
- Autopicking

**Known "issues":**
- Detection/Steal alarm seems to work a bit weird, and gives a really low bounty atm

**Compatibility:**
- Not compatible with mods that do similar things.
